/**
 * y/hub serves the same rooms over two transports, mounted side by side under one prefix:
 * `{prefix}/ws/v1/{org}/{docid}` for the websocket and `{prefix}/ydoc/v1/{org}/{docid}` over
 * plain http. The two providers spell a room differently — y-websocket takes a base url and
 * appends the room name, the http provider takes the org and the docid apart — so this reads
 * the org out of the websocket url and hands back what `HttpProvider` needs.
 *
 * Returns undefined for a url that is not shaped like one. An instance configured with
 * something else then simply has no http fallback, rather than polling an address nobody
 * serves.
